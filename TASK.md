2. [ ] Set up development environment
3. [ ] Define Pydantic models for core entities
4. [ ] Create basic CLI skeleton with Typer
5. [ ] Implement first working command (e.g., `vpn version`)

### Next Sprint Planning
- Review Phase 1 requirements
- Assign team responsibilities
- Set up project tracking
- Schedule architecture review

## 📝 Notes

### Migration Considerations
- Maintain backward compatibility with Rust config files
- Provide automated migration tools
- Support gradual migration (both versions can coexist)
- Document breaking changes clearly

### Architecture Decisions
- **Async First**: Use asyncio throughout for consistency
- **Type Safety**: Enforce with mypy in strict mode
- **Modular Design**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Plugin System**: Consider for future extensibility
- **API First**: Design with API in mind for future web UI

### Risk Management
- Performance regression testing against Rust version
- Memory usage monitoring during development
- Security audit before release
- User acceptance testing with beta program
