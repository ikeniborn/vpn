## üìã Docker Compose Migration Plan

### New Architecture Overview
**Focus**: Docker + Docker Compose instead of containerd abstraction  
**Rationale**: Proven technology, simpler deployment, better tooling ecosystem  
**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks for core implementation  

### Service Architecture
```yaml
# docker-compose.yml structure
services:
  traefik:        # Reverse proxy, load balancing, SSL termination
  vpn-server:     # Xray/VLESS with Reality
  vpn-identity:   # Authentication and authorization service
  prometheus:     # Metrics collection
  grafana:        # Monitoring dashboards
  jaeger:         # Distributed tracing
  postgres:       # User database
  redis:          # Session storage
  vpn-api:        # Management API
```

### Benefits of Docker Compose Approach
- **Simplified Deployment**: One command deployment (`docker-compose up`)
- **Service Isolation**: Each component in separate container
- **Easy Scaling**: Built-in scaling (`docker-compose up --scale vpn-server=3`)
- **Health Monitoring**: Native health checks and restart policies
- **Network Management**: Automatic service discovery and networking
- **Volume Management**: Persistent data and configuration management
- **Environment Flexibility**: Easy dev/staging/production configurations

### Migration Strategy
1. **Phase 1**: Create Docker Compose templates for existing services
2. **Phase 2**: Implement service orchestration and dependencies
3. **Phase 3**: Add monitoring and observability stack
4. **Phase 4**: Implement multi-environment support
5. **Phase 5**: Add high availability and scaling features
