## Architecture Overview

The architecture integrates two powerful VPN technologies:

- **Shadowsocks (Outline Server)**: First-layer proxy providing initial encryption and client management
- **VLESS+Reality**: Second-layer proxy with advanced obfuscation and fingerprinting capabilities

### Key Components

1. **Outline Server Container**
   - Runs Shadowsocks server with obfuscation plugins
   - Manages user access and authentication
   - Initial encryption layer using ChaCha20-IETF-Poly1305
   - Routes traffic to VLESS+Reality server

2. **v2ray Container**
   - Implements VLESS protocol with Reality TLS simulation
   - Advanced traffic routing rules for different content types
   - Fingerprinting evasion and TLS simulation
   - Final internet connectivity

3. **Docker Network**
   - Isolated bridge network between containers
   - Internal routing optimizations
   - Security boundary enforcement

4. **Management Layer**
   - Unified user management across both systems
   - Monitoring and health checks
   - Performance optimization scripts

## Traffic Routing Optimization

The system implements intelligent traffic routing to maximize performance and security:

### Content-Based Routing

1. **Streaming Media Traffic**
   - Identified via domain and protocol detection
   - Optimized for low latency and high throughput
   - Dedicated outbound connections with TCP optimization

2. **General Browsing Traffic**
   - Default routing with balanced settings
   - Lower priority than streaming when bandwidth contention occurs

3. **Blocked Traffic Categories**
   - Advertisements and malicious domains
   - Private network addresses
   - Blackholed to prevent leakage

### Routing Rules Implementation

```json
{
  "routing": {
    "domainStrategy": "IPIfNonMatch",
    "rules": [
      {
        "type": "field",
        "domain": [
          "youtube.com", "googlevideo.com",
          "netflix.com", "netflixdnstest.com",
          "hulu.com", "hulustream.com"
        ],
        "outboundTag": "streaming_out"
      },
      {
        "type": "field",
        "domain": ["geosite:category-ads"],
        "outboundTag": "blocked"
      },
      {
        "type": "field",
        "protocol": ["bittorrent"],
        "outboundTag": "direct"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Security Enhancement Mechanisms

Multiple security layers protect the connection against detection and analysis:

### Dual-Layer Encryption

1. **First Layer (Shadowsocks)**
   - ChaCha20-IETF-Poly1305 encryption
   - Independent per-user secrets
   - HTTP obfuscation to hide Shadowsocks traffic signatures

2. **Second Layer (VLESS+Reality)**
   - Advanced TLS fingerprinting simulation
   - Mimics legitimate website TLS handshakes
   - Short ID validation before connection acceptance

### Access Control

1. **Authentication Isolation**
   - Shadowsocks user authentication at entry point
   - VLESS user validation as second check
   - Traffic segregation between users

2. **Exposure Minimization**
   - VLESS+Reality server not directly exposed to internet
   - Only Shadowsocks port publicly accessible
   - Internal Docker network for container communication

### Connection Verification

1. **Destination Verification**
   - Server mimics trusted TLS destinations (e.g., Microsoft.com)
   - Client verification of server TLS signatures
   - Mutual authentication between layers

## Connection Resilience

The architecture provides robust connectivity even in challenging network conditions:

### Fault Tolerance

1. **Container Health Monitoring**
   - Automatic container restarts if services fail
   - Health check probes for both Shadowsocks and VLESS services
   - Logging and alerting for connectivity issues

2. **Network Layer Resilience**
   - TCP keepalive optimizations
   - Automatic reconnection logic
   - Session persistence during brief outages

### Traffic Management

1. **Bandwidth Controls**
   - Fair allocation between users
   - Prioritization of interactive traffic
   - Burst handling for variable bandwidth situations

## Latency Minimization

Specific optimizations reduce latency for improved responsiveness:

### Protocol Optimizations

1. **TCP Optimizations**
   - Fast open for reduced handshake times
   - Optimized congestion control algorithms
   - Reduced bufferbloat through appropriate buffer sizing

2. **Connection Management**
   - Connection pooling for frequent destinations
   - Persistent connections where appropriate
   - Efficient connection reuse

### Routing Optimizations

1. **Direct Path Selection**
   - Streaming traffic takes optimized path
   - Reduced hops for latency-sensitive applications
   - Optimized DNS resolution

## Implementation Components

The implementation consists of several key files and configurations:
