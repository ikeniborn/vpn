   - Connection reuse and pooling
   - Kernel parameter tuning

3. **Resource Efficiency**
   - Container resource limits
   - Load balancing capabilities
   - Scalable architecture

### Resilience Improvements

1. **Fault Tolerance**
   - Automatic service recovery
   - Health monitoring system
   - Connection failover mechanisms

2. **Backup & Recovery**
   - Automated backup procedures
   - Quick restoration capabilities

2. Clone the repository or copy implementation files
3. Execute the setup script with appropriate parameters:
   ```bash
   # For x86_64 architecture
   sudo ./scripts/setup.sh
   
   # For ARM64 architecture
   export SB_IMAGE=ken1029/shadowbox:latest
   sudo ./scripts/setup.sh
   ```
4. Verify the deployment with health checks
5. Set up monitoring and maintenance procedures
6. Create initial users and test connections
