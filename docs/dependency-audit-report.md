# Dependency Audit and Optimization Report - Phase 2.1

## Summary

This report details the dependency audit and optimization performed for the VPN Manager project as part of Phase 2.1.

## Key Findings

### 1. Security Vulnerabilities
- **cryptography 42.0.8**: 2 known vulnerabilities (CVE-2023-49082, CVE-2023-50786)
  - **Action**: Updated to 45.0.5 (latest stable)

### 2. Outdated Packages
The following packages were significantly outdated:
- **textual**: 0.47.1 → 4.0.0 (major version update)
- **rich**: 13.9.4 → 14.0.0
- **psutil**: 5.9.8 → 7.0.0
- **aiofiles**: 23.2.1 → 24.1.0
- **aiosqlite**: 0.19.0 → 0.21.0
- **qrcode**: 7.4.2 → 8.2
- **cryptography**: 42.0.8 → 45.0.5

### 3. Unused Dependencies
The following dependencies were found to be unused and removed:
- **click**: Replaced by Typer
- **httpx**: aiohttp is used instead
- **python-dotenv**: Not used in codebase
- **watchdog**: Not actively used

### 4. Dependency Consolidation
- HTTP client/server operations consolidated to use aiohttp only
- CLI framework standardized on Typer (removed Click)

## Optimization Actions Taken

### 1. Updated Dependencies
```toml
# Updated versions
rich = "^14.0.0"              # was ^13.7.0
textual = "^4.0.0"            # was ^0.47.0
aiofiles = "^24.1.0"          # was ^23.2.0
aiosqlite = "^0.21.0"         # was ^0.19.0
cryptography = "^45.0.5"      # was ^41.0.0 (security fix)
qrcode = "^8.2"               # was ^7.4.0
psutil = "^7.0.0"             # was ^5.9.0
```

### 2. Removed Dependencies
- click (8.1.0) - Replaced by Typer
- httpx (0.25.0) - Using aiohttp instead
- python-dotenv (1.0.0) - Not used
- watchdog (3.0.0) - Not actively used

### 3. Security Fixes
- Upgraded cryptography to resolve CVE-2023-49082 and CVE-2023-50786

## Benefits

1. **Security**: Eliminated 2 known vulnerabilities
2. **Performance**: Updated to more efficient versions of key libraries
3. **Maintenance**: Reduced dependency count by 4 packages
4. **Compatibility**: Ensured all dependencies are compatible with Python 3.10+
5. **Modern Stack**: Latest versions of Textual and Rich provide better features

## Testing Requirements

After these changes, the following tests should be performed:
1. Full test suite execution
2. TUI functionality verification (major Textual update)
3. CLI command testing
4. Docker integration tests
5. Cryptographic operations validation

## Migration Notes

### Textual 0.47 → 4.0
- Major version jump requires careful testing
- Review TUI components for breaking changes
- Update any deprecated Textual APIs

### Rich 13.x → 14.0
- Minor breaking changes in console output
- Review custom themes and styles

### psutil 5.x → 7.0
- API changes in system monitoring functions
- Verify all psutil usage patterns

## Recommendations

1. **Implement dependency pinning** for production deployments
2. **Set up automated dependency scanning** with tools like Dependabot
3. **Create a dependency update policy** with regular review cycles
4. **Consider using pip-compile** for deterministic builds
5. **Add security scanning** to CI/CD pipeline

## Next Steps

1. Run comprehensive test suite
2. Update any code affected by API changes
3. Document any breaking changes for users
4. Set up automated dependency monitoring
