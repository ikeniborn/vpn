## Completed Tasks

* Initial VPN solution setup with multiple protocols (V2Ray and OutlineVPN/Shadowsocks)
* Implemented network isolation using Docker networks
* Set up monitoring with Prometheus, Alertmanager, and Grafana
* Configured Traefik as a reverse proxy with TLS
* Created a cover website to make the VPN service less conspicuous
* Added backup service for configuration and data
* Created Memory Bank for project context tracking
* Fixed firewall.sh script to check for required packages and install them if missing
* Enhanced script resilience by adding package dependency checks for UFW, knockd, and iptables

## Current Tasks

* Fixed permission issues in Nginx management container by adding appropriate tmpfs mounts
* Resolved read-only filesystem limitations in Docker containers while maintaining security
* Fixed V2Ray service by adding proper command directive in docker-compose.yml
* Updated V2Ray configuration to fix deprecated "root fakedns settings" warning
* Fixed Docker socket permission issues by adding user to docker group, allowing Traefik and backup containers to access the socket
* Enhanced Docker socket permissions by explicitly setting group ID (988) in volume mounts
* Ensuring all containerized services start and operate correctly
* Fixed Docker socket permission issues in Traefik and backup containers by using explicit volume mount options (`:ro,group=988`) instead of group_add directives

## Next Steps

* Identify potential improvements or optimizations
* Address any security vulnerabilities
* Consider additional features or enhancements
* Create detailed plans for any required changes
