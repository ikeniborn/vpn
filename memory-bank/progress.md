  * Fixed Docker network creation error
  * Improved v2ray container setup with better volume mapping for logs
  * Enhanced tunnel diagnostics and error reporting
  * Fixed Reality protocol configuration JSON formatting
  * Added robust container startup validation and debugging
  * Implemented JSON configuration validation with auto-repair
  * Added debug mode fallback for container failures
  * Fixed container command issues causing "unknown command" errors
  * Completely rewrote the configuration templating to ensure valid JSON
  * Added proper JSON object construction for Reality settings
  * Increased log level to debug for better diagnostics
  * Improved configuration visualization for troubleshooting
  * Completely rebuilt the script with proper error handling
  * Created a direct JSON generation approach with controlled variable interpolation
  * Added explicit UUID format validation and verification steps
  * Returned to default Docker entrypoint without custom command arguments
  * Implemented cleaner conditional inclusion of optional parameters
  * Added automatic fixing with jq if validation fails
  * Enhanced error reporting with specific checks for missing values
  * Simplified overall approach to reduce complexity and potential errors
  * Created YouTube traffic monitoring scripts:
     * monitor-youtube-traffic-server1.sh - Monitors incoming YouTube traffic on Server 1
     * monitor-youtube-traffic-server2.sh - Monitors outgoing YouTube traffic from Outline VPN clients on Server 2
     * Added comprehensive documentation in youtube-traffic-monitoring.md
     * ✅ Successfully implemented and verified
* Created fix for "context canceled" error in VLESS tunnel:
  * Created fix-server-uuid.sh script to add Server 2's UUID to Server 1's client list
  * Added detection of Reality parameter mismatches between servers
  * Created comprehensive troubleshooting guide in vless-reality-tunnel-troubleshooting.md
  * Documented the root cause and solution process
  * ✅ Solution implemented and documented

## Current Tasks

* Testing the fix-server-uuid.sh script on production servers
* Validating that the tunnel connection works properly after applying the fix
* Exploring automatic detection and resolution of configuration mismatches
* Testing the new traffic monitoring scripts between Server 1 and Server 2

## Next Steps
  
* Review current implementation for any security improvements
