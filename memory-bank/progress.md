2025-05-19 11:04:48 - Initial Memory Bank creation.
2025-05-19 11:21:29 - Added tunnel setup scripts for two-server configuration.

## Completed Tasks

* Created core setup script (setup-vless-reality-server.sh)
* Implemented user management script (manage-vless-users.sh)
* Created firewall configuration script (firewall.sh) 
* Implemented security checks script (security-checks-reality.sh)
* Documented installation process in vless-reality-new-server-guide.md
* Documented comparison between WebSocket+TLS and Reality in websocket-tls-vs-reality.md
* Created scripts for two-server tunnel setup:
  * setup-vless-server1.sh - For configuring the first server to accept connections
  * setup-vless-server2.sh - For configuring the second server to route through the first
  * tunnel-routing.conf - Configuration file for consistent routing rules
  * test-tunnel-connection.sh - Script to verify tunnel functionality
  * route-outline-through-tunnel.sh - Helper script to update existing Outline installations

## Current Tasks

* Fixed error in setup-vless-reality-server.sh script:
  * Resolved issue with x25519 key generation that was causing "unknown command" errors
  * Replaced Docker container key generation with direct OpenSSL-based approach
  * âœ… Fixed successfully and verified working
* Fixed issues in setup-vless-server2.sh:
  * Fixed Docker network creation error
  * Improved v2ray container setup with better volume mapping for logs
  * Enhanced tunnel diagnostics and error reporting
  * Fixed Reality protocol configuration JSON formatting
  * Added robust container startup validation and debugging
  * Implemented JSON configuration validation with auto-repair
  * Added debug mode fallback for container failures
  * Fixed container command issues causing "unknown command" errors
  * Completely rewrote the configuration templating to ensure valid JSON
  * Added proper JSON object construction for Reality settings
  * Increased log level to debug for better diagnostics
  * Improved configuration visualization for troubleshooting
  * Completely rebuilt the script with proper error handling
  * Created a dedicated configuration generator script with strict JSON construction
  * Made proper parameter passing with strict validation
  * Added proper handling of optional parameters like publicKey and shortId
  * Simplified container command line to avoid "unknown command" errors
  * Implemented fatal validation to prevent startup with invalid configuration
  * Moved from inline generation to external script for better maintainability
  * Added proper cleanup and detailed logging throughout the process

## Next Steps

* Review current implementation for any security improvements
* Consider adding monitoring capabilities to detect issues
* Implement automatic updates for v2ray components
* Enhance client configuration export with improved documentation
* Consider creating a simple web UI for user management
* Create deployment documentation for the two-server tunnel configuration
* Implement fail-over or backup server configuration
