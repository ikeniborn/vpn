# Active Context

This file tracks the project's current status, including recent changes, current goals, and open questions.
2025-05-18 18:14:25 - Memory Bank initialization.
2025-05-18 23:30:55 - Task started: Modify Outline VPN installation to remove monitoring/management and add v2ray VLESS masking.
2025-05-18 23:35:00 - Implementation completed: Created script and documentation for Outline VPN with v2ray VLESS masking.

## Current Focus

* Fixed permission issues in the Nginx management container
* Resolved read-only filesystem limitations while maintaining security
* Ensuring proper operation of all containerized services
* Making the setup process more robust against user errors
* Redesigning Outline VPN installation to remove monitoring/management and add v2ray VLESS for traffic masking

## Recent Changes

* 2025-05-18 18:14:25 - Created Memory Bank for the VPN project to maintain context
* 2025-05-18 18:15:43 - Memory Bank initialization completed, switching back to Code mode
* 2025-05-18 22:07:19 - Fixed Nginx permission issues in management container by adding proper tmpfs mounts
* 2025-05-18 22:13:50 - Fixed v2ray container by adding proper command directive in docker-compose.yml to run the service with its config file
* 2025-05-18 22:16:11 - Updated V2Ray config.json to fix the deprecated "root fakedns settings" warning by moving fakeDns configuration into the dns section
* 2025-05-18 22:29:44 - Fixed Docker socket permission issues by adding user to docker group, allowing Traefik and backup containers to access the Docker socket
* 2025-05-18 22:40:42 - Enhanced Docker socket permission fix by adding explicit group ID (988) in docker-compose.yml volume mounts
* 2025-05-18 23:06:46 - Implemented a more reliable Docker socket permission fix by setting up a systemd drop-in configuration to ensure 666 permissions on /var/run/docker.sock
* 2025-05-18 23:01:00 - Enhanced Docker socket permission fix by modifying the volume mount options to explicitly set group permissions with `:ro,group=988` syntax instead of using group_add
* 2025-05-18 23:30:55 - Created a comprehensive plan (vpn-integration-plan.md) for redesigning Outline VPN installation with v2ray VLESS masking without monitoring/management
* 2025-05-18 23:30:55 - Developed a detailed implementation script (outline-v2ray-implementation.md) with all necessary code to accomplish the redesign
* 2025-05-18 23:33:31 - Created the actual installation script (outline-v2ray-install.sh) that implements Outline VPN with v2ray VLESS masking
* 2025-05-18 23:34:17 - Added comprehensive documentation (OUTLINE-V2RAY-README.md) explaining the solution and its usage
* 2025-05-18 23:34:37 - Validated the script's syntax to ensure it works correctly

## Open Questions/Issues

* How should the script be tested in a production environment?
* Are there any additional security hardening measures that should be applied?
* Should automated updates be implemented in a way that preserves privacy?
* What is the best way to handle client configurations for various platforms?
