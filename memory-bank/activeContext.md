# Active Context

This file tracks the project's current status, including recent changes, current goals, and open questions.
2025-05-19 11:04:37 - Initial Memory Bank creation.
2025-05-19 11:21:52 - Added tunnel setup between two servers with Outline VPN.

## Current Focus

* Implementation of two-server tunnel configuration using VLESS+Reality protocol
* Enable routing traffic from the second server through the first server
* Setting up Outline VPN on the second server with tunneled traffic

## Recent Changes

* Memory Bank initialization (2025-05-19)
* Created productContext.md to document the high-level overview of the project
* Created scripts for two-server tunnel setup (2025-05-19):
  * setup-vless-server1.sh - Configure first server as tunnel entry point
  * setup-vless-server2.sh - Configure second server to route through first server
  * tunnel-routing.conf - Shared routing configuration
  * test-tunnel-connection.sh - Diagnostic script
  * route-outline-through-tunnel.sh - Script to update existing Outline installations
* Fixed setup-vless-reality-server.sh script (2025-05-19):
  * Resolved the "unknown command" error with x25519 key generation
  * Replaced Docker container key generation with direct OpenSSL-based approach
  * Successfully verified script functionality

## Open Questions/Issues

* What are the primary use cases and target users for this VPN solution?
* Are there any specific improvements or features that need to be developed next?
* What security audits or testing have been performed on the current implementation?
* Are there any known limitations or areas for improvement in the current Reality protocol implementation?
* Is there a need for additional client-side configurations or support for other platforms?
* Should we implement automatic failover between multiple servers?
* Would a monitoring system for the tunnel status be beneficial?
* How can we improve error handling and diagnostics for tunnel setup issues?
* Should we implement logging rotation for v2ray logs?
