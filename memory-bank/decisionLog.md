# Decision Log

This file records architectural and implementation decisions using a list format.

## Decision

* Use Docker containerization for service isolation and deployment
* Implement multiple VPN protocols (V2Ray and OutlineVPN/Shadowsocks) for versatility
* Use Traefik as reverse proxy for routing and TLS termination
* Implement network segmentation with isolated Docker networks
* Add a cover website to make the VPN service less conspicuous
* Implement a comprehensive monitoring solution with Prometheus, Alertmanager, and Grafana
* Set up automated encrypted backups for disaster recovery

## Rationale 

* Docker provides isolation, portability, and simplified deployment
* Multiple VPN protocols offer redundancy and options to bypass network restrictions
* Traefik provides modern, container-aware reverse proxy capabilities with automatic TLS
* Network segmentation enhances security by limiting attack surface
* A cover website helps avoid detection by censors
* Monitoring ensures system health and performance visibility
* Automated backups protect against data loss and facilitate disaster recovery

## Implementation Details

* Docker Compose for orchestration with defined networks and volumes
* V2Ray with WebSocket transport for better censorship evasion
* OutlineVPN/Shadowsocks for simpler client setup
* Traefik with Let's Encrypt for automatic certificate management
* Four isolated Docker networks (frontend, vpn_services, management, backup)
* Prometheus, Alertmanager with Telegram notifications, and Grafana dashboards
* Encrypted backups with retention policy and failure notifications
