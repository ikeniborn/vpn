## Coding Patterns

* Container-based deployment with Docker and Docker Compose
* Environment variables for configuration through .env file
* Read-only file systems where possible for enhanced security
* Non-root users for service execution
* Healthchecks for all container services
* Network isolation through separate Docker networks

## Architectural Patterns

* Layered security approach (defense in depth)
  - Network segmentation
  - Firewall rules
  - TLS encryption
  - Authentication for admin interfaces
  - Traffic obfuscation
* Microservices architecture with focused containers
* Reverse proxy pattern for routing and TLS termination
* Cover service pattern (legitimate-looking frontend)
* Observability pattern (monitoring, alerting, visualization)

## Testing Patterns

* Security checks via dedicated script (security-checks.sh)
* Container health monitoring
* Regular backup verification
* System monitoring with alerting thresholds
